## Controller configuration
This robot was designed to run using the FlySky FS-i6X flight controller, an off the shelf radio transmitter/reciever. The RF reciever outputs a PPM signal, which is interpreted by software and used
to drive both the robot and swappable modules. 

The controls are modified from default, with the configuration used detailed here: [RC Transmitter Setup](transmitter-setup.md)
